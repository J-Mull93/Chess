The problem:
In this repository I recreate an interactive game of chess from scratch.

The solution / files:
09/06/2022 - All code is currently in a Jupyter Notebook. I plan the to split the functionality into modules (pieces / gameplay) with a separate file to run it interactively.

Next steps:
09/06/2022: I have developed much of the basic functionality in jupyter notebooks and this will be added over the coming weeks. Includes:
- Piece classes
- Interactive piece movement with error handling
- Storing piece locations
- Castling
- Pawn promotion
- En passant
- Tests for in-check

09/06/2022: I am looking to develop:
- Logic to terminate the game via checkmate / stalemate / repetition
- Visuals
